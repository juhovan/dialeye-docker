USAGE: 
       python dialEye.py --help

           Outputs help text
        
       python dialEye.py [<common options>] showconf
       
           Generates an image with the current calibration image on the background
           with calibration information drawn into the image corresponding to 
           the current configuration. Outputs the image to file dialeye_conf.png 
           in current directory.
           
       python dialEye.py [<common options>] [-r] [-d] [-s] 
                         [[-u] [--username <user> --password <pass>]] 
                         meter <image_file or URL>
       
           Reads configuration file information, calibration image and <image_file>
           file or URL given on the command line. Uses detection algorithm to determine
           the reading of the configured rotary meter dials. Outputs the value to 
           standard output most significant dial first. Example output with 
           4 dials configured: 3474. On error or when not able to detect one or more
           of the dials, returns "ERROR:" and description of the error on one row.
           
           Meter command options:
           
               -r  Outputs an image of the detected meters as a result image to 
                   file dialeye_result.png in the current directory.

               -d  The shaking is disabled and only the possible existing saved 
                   shake configuration will be used (this is faster, but does 
                   not follow possible camera movement).

               -s  The calculated shake result will be saved in the configured 
                   shake file.

               -u  The image name given after meter keyword is considered to be an URL.
				   If URL requires basic authentication, use options --username and 
				   --password to provide authentication information.
           
        Common options:
           
           [-v] [-g] [-f <config_file>] [-c <calibration_image_file>]
           
           -v    Verbose output. Outputs debug information of the operations.
           
           -g    If -g option is given, will not write graphical output to 
                 a result file. Instead opens the result image in new window.
                 (requires a graphical environment)
          
           -f <config_file>
                 Use <config_file> as dialEye config file. 
                 (Default: use dialEye.conf in current directory)
                 
           -c <calibration_image_file>
                 If defined, uses <calibration_image_file> as the calibration
                 image. (Default: use calibration image defined in the configuration 
                 file.)
